# cw_sankey_gui
Coursework which uses the ezgraphics package in Python to create a sankey diagram using data from text files.

The lines of code in the "main" function and at the start with "###" at the end were given as default lines.
Lines with "#####" at the end of them were given as default but had values changed.

To access the different .txt files, use "data/name_here".
